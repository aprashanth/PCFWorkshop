## Topic 2 - Slack Intro

If you have never used slack before this will help you get setup and logged in.

#### Step 1: Create an Account

Open https://thdengops.slack.com/signup
> NOTE to THD Mexico: change the email drop down to **@homedepot.com.mx**

You can choose whatever username and password you want, and they are **NOT** tied back to ActiveDirectory (AD) or LDAP.


#### Optional: Download Desktop and/or Mobile Client

Open https://thdengops.slack.com/downloads

Choose the desktop client that matches your OS.

You can also download a mobile client as well.

#### Optional: Add your First and Last names

In either the Desktop app or directly in the website, click on your name at the top left just under the heading "THD Technology"

Click "View Profile & Account"

Click the "Edit" button.

If you want, please enter your First Name and Last Name. Feel to provide the other information, if you want. Your choice.

Click "Save Changes" button.


#### Step 2: Join or Create or Muting Channels

At the top left you will see the words "CHANNELS(348)", which means at this time there are 348 public channels you can join.

Click on the word CHANNELS to get a full searchable list. Most are business oriented, but some are fun and not THD related. (such as #games_and_gamers).  Happy Searching!

If you do not see a channel you want, click on "New channel" button at the top right, and create the channel you want.  

You can create Public or Private channels. This is great for inter-team discussions to work out issues.

If a channel is "noisy" and you want to stay in it, but not get alerted every time something occurs, then when you have the channel open you will see the channel name at the top left, just to the right of "THD Technology".


#### Step 3: Direct Messaging
You can easily direct message (DM) anybody on slack. Click on "DIRECT MESSAGES" on the left side.  

Type the name of the individual you are looking for and chat away.


#### Step 4: Tagging a co-worker in a channel
If in a channel and you want to specifically alert somebody to a discussion, you type @user-name, so @bill-smith or @axr0000 or whatever their username is.  

Their slack client will alert them that they have been mentioned.
#### Step 5: Etiquette

Please use this *ONLY* when needed.

If you want to alert everybody in a channel you can type @channel and type your message.  Every person will be alerted to the message.

If you want to only alert the people who are currently logged in you can type @here and your message.

Again, be kind.  Do all 500 people in the channel need to have their clients alert for this message or can you wait for people to read it in time?

#### Step 6: Advanced Topics: Formatting

Sometimes when sharing code or other non-comment type messages.  You need to properly format your message.  Rather than repeat the information, please read slack's official formatting guide:

[Slack.com Formating Guide](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Formatting-your-messages)

#### Step 7: Advanced Topics: Homerbot

Create a direct message to the user @homer. THen you can type "homer help"

If this doesn't work, no worries, sometimes homer gets sick.  He will be better soon. :D

#### Step 8: Advanced Topics: Slash commands

Slash comes with many built in commands.  Rather than restate them, take a look at the full list of commands at [Slack Commands](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201259356-Using-slash-commands)
