## Topic 3 - Intro to git & GitHub

If you have never used git before this will help you get setup and logged in.

#### Step 1: Create an account

Go to https://github.com/

Create a personal account.  Its free as long as you don't need to have private repositories.

#### Step 2: Login

Login using the credentials you used above.

For issues with login please use SLACK. There are others who will be more than happy to help.

#### Step 3: Install a git client.

The DevTools team has put together a solid [Getting Started](https://github.homedepot.com/Homedepot/Getting_Started/wiki) wiki.  

Although you can certainly use the Desktop client or the command line interface, the feedback so far has been that using the command line client will help you to gain a much deeper understanding of git.

#### Step 3: More information

GitHub is one of the most popular sites for code on the internet, so there are many external tutorials that you can search for.  

Also, you can always use the #git channel in slack to ask for any help.
