## Topic 3 - Intro to git & GitHub

If you have never used git before this will help you get setup and logged in.

#### Step 1: Create an account

Go to https://github.com/

Create a personal account

#### Step 1: Login

Open https://github.homedepot.com

Login using your Production LDAP.

If you get an error logging in, then you may need to use the [Access Request Portal (ARP)](https://accessrequestportal.homedepot.com) to request access to the GG_SCM_Access LDAP group.

For issues with ARP please use the #security slack channel.

#### Step 2: Install a git client.

The DevTools team has put together a solid [Getting Started](https://github.homedepot.com/Homedepot/Getting_Started/wiki) wiki.  

Although you can certainly use the Desktop client or the command line interface, the feedback so far has been that using the command line client will help you to gain a much deeper understanding of git.

#### Step 3: More information

GitHub is one of the most popular sites for code on the internet, so there are many external tutorials that you can search for.  

Also, you can always use the #git channel in slack to ask for any help.
