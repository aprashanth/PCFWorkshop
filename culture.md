# TOPIC 1 - Overview

#### We are in the midst of a transformation to how we build software at The Home Depot.

* Social Coding
  * Slack, GitHub
* Empowering Developers
  * Pivotal Cloud Foundry
  * Self-service models
  * Removing "orange tape"
* Engineering Excellence
  * XP Principles
  * 12 Factor Apps
  * Cloud Native
  * DevOps
  * Site Reliability Engineers (SRE)

#### But with great power comes great responsibility.

* You build it.  You support it.
* DIFM vs. DIY
* Instrumentation, logging, monitoring (PCF helps)
